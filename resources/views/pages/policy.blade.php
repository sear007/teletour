            <p>
                TELE TOURS respects your privacy and we will do our utmost to ensure the information you supply is kept
                private and secure. We protect the privacy of your personal information. This applies to information
                supplied to us in the following situations:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Making Tour request</li>
                <li>Requesting a brochure</li>
                <li>Making a booking</li>
                <li>In a tour registration form</li>
                <li>Subscribing to our newsletter</li>
                <li>Entering a competition</li>
                <li>Under any other agreement or arrangement</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                How is your personal information used?<br>
                The information you give helps us provide you with personalized service. When you supply information about
                yourself for specific purposes, we use the information for that purpose only (i.e. to provide the service or
                information you have requested). If making a booking with us, additional information will be required for
                operational reasons.<br>
                We do not share, sell or rent information to any third parties. Tele Tours is anti-spam. If you receive
                information from Tele Tours, it is because you have asked to hear from us, you have entered a competition
                and agreed to join our mailing list, or a friend/colleague has requested it on your behalf.
            </p>

            <p>
                Choice to opt out<br>
                If you have registered to receive communications from us and later change your mind, you may contact us to
                have your name removed from our distribution lists. Our e-newsletter gives you the option to unsubscribe via
                a link at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can contact us via email.
            </p>

            <p>
                Who views your information?<br>
                Tele Tours may disclose personal information to other members within the company where necessary to fulfill
                our purposes.<br>
                We may also disclose your personal information to third parties (contractors to whom we contract out certain
                services) for the purpose for which the information was collected.<br>
                For example, we currently engage third party contractors to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Provide transport, including flights</li>
                <li>Organize and operate tours</li>
                <li>Provide software and hardware application hosting services</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In these situations, we prohibit the third party contractor from using personal information about you except
                for the specific purpose for which we supply it.<br>
                Other than the above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure
                is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorized or required by law, reasonably
                necessary to enforce the law, or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Transfer of information overseas<br>
                We may transfer to people in foreign countries any of your personal information to fulfill the purposes set
                out in this Privacy Statement (e.g. international offices of Tele Tours, airlines, hotels, tour operators,
                and ground handlers).<br>
                In the majority of cases, the transfer of information will be necessary for the fulfillment of our
                obligations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anonymous information collected<br>

                click-stream information is collected from every visitor. This includes pages viewed, date and time, and
                browser type. IP numbers are used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region. We do not
                make any association between this information and a visitorâ€™s identity.
            </p>
